WTF pre-image of normal vectors
Two 10-d spaces, principle angles
Sign of distance matrix (PD,ND)
Dimension of tangent space
Is map lipschitz, ctns wrt schedule
Move straight in every basis vector for a good epsilon ball, approx tangent space at every layer, track how singular values change, mean center data as you go (find SVD of ball around x minus x)
Make sure epsilon ball is uniformly sized
